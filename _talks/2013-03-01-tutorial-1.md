Exploring two methods that solve for a solution to effectively reconstruct noisy images. 
The reconstructed image is denoised and restored. Check out my [publication](https://www.ijert.org/research/exploring-image-reconstruction-with-orthogonal-matching-pursuit-and-least-angle-regression-IJERTV11IS110080.pdf)


Compressed sensing is a technique in signal processing that is able to reconstruct a signal by solving undetermined linear systems. 
There are two conditions under which this is possible; sparsity and incoherence.
Sparsity is the property that signals can be well-approximated by a few coefficients in a certain, sparse basis. 

After I graduated, the work of a professor from Stanford, i.e. Professor David Donoho, had me deeply interested in sparse representation modeling. 
I wanted to extensively explore solving for sparse solutions to reconstruct an image; therefore, in this paper, I used images from a noisy dataset 
and reconstructed a denoised image using the LARS and OMP algorithms. 

Essentially, SSIM is a perception-based metric that calculates image
quality degradation. I learned that through varying non-zero coefficients and measuring the resulting PSNR and SSIM values, 
OMP has a higher reconstruction quality. 
However, OMP fails to reconstruct a sparse vector when the columns of the projection matrix are highly correlated. 
LARS does not face this problem.
