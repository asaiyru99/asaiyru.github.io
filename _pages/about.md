My name is Prachii and my work lies in generative AI, specifically LLMs and natural language processing. 
Some of AI’s dependencies are the nature of data and hardware, 
and I focus on optimizing these constraints with my love for signal 
processing and analog electronics. I have a personal vision to 
revolutionize Human—AI interaction through my research in Markov Blankets 
and my perception framework; essence. 

On the electronics front end: I am well familiar with embedded Linux and used a 
minimal Linux distribution (buildroot) to create the root file systems 
for IP cameras. My work focused on integrating the image 
signal processors to build in-house IP cameras.  
I’ve dabbled in microcontrollers to monitor core functions in multi-component 
system (Intel NUC, IP cameras, battery source etc).


Edge AI is on the rise for the intelligent inference of an AI model, but we still have a way to go for generative AI. 
I am also a curious person and adore my two dogs Hebi and Roxy.
