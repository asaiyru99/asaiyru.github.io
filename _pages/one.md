I currently work locally on an RTX 3060 with a Ryzen 9 5900HX. However since 
I only have 6GB of dedicated GPU memory, I use a cloud GPU with RTX 4090 and 
24GB VRAM to train my models. I also use NVIDIAâ€™s Jetson AGX Orin with 
64GB for any robotics projects that I want to test out. 
I think Jetson is quite fun as it runs the NVIDIA AI software stack, 
and with specific application frameworks like Isaac for robotics, 
DeepStream for vision AI, and Riva for conversational AI.
